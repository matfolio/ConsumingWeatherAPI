Using Nodejs to consume weather API using the openWeatherMap API

### installation
after the cloning the of the project you can execute npm install to get all the installed dependencies into your working project.
```
npm install 
```
### execution
The backend for this simple application using nodejs and ejs as the templating engine.
under the hood I am using Reactjs to render component into the view. Quite convenient given the 
capability of reactjs for this functionality (portability).
check the main component (index.js) for the implementation.

To execute this simple application:

open two command prompt or terminal ,
1. run the command: ``` webpack ``` in the first terminal to bundle the source codes and get the codes transpiled using the installed modules or loaders.
2. run the command: ``` npm start ``` in the second terminal which implicitly run node in watch mode.

## NOTE: 
cloning the project from github, you have to:

run ```npm install``` after downloading the project to lock the project dependency at the time of creating this project.
